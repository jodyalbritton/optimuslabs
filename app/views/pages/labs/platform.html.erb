                    <p>The Optimus Platform is an entire suite of tools designed around the needs of the small business owner. You can manage your customers or clients, keep track of inventory, manage service requests, and much much more. Optimus Labs is dedicated to designing easy to use tools at affordable prices.</p>
                    <p class="lead">You should not have to spend more money to manage your clients than you make working for those clients.</p>
                    <p>We are not reinventing the wheel, <strong>most of these tools are available elsewhere.</strong> We <em>are</em> reinventing pricing schemes for these tools. The Optimus Platform is simply priced to be within reach of small business owners who need every last penny.</p>
                    <p>While affordable, the platform is not carbon copy solution for every customer. Each customer recieves their own platform with all of the features turned on by default. You turn off what you don't need and only pay for what you use. </p>
